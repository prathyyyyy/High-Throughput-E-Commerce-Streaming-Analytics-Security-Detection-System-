# High-Throughput E-Commerce Streaming Analytics & Security Detection System

## 📌 Overview

This project is a scalable, cloud-native **eCommerce analytics and security detection system** built on **AWS**. It processes **67M+ events** using batch and real-time pipelines to deliver business insights while detecting anomalous traffic, bots, and potential DDoS attacks in near real time.

The system is designed for **high throughput, low latency, fault tolerance, and cost-efficient storage**, making it suitable for large-scale data-driven platforms.

## ⚙️ Data Pipeline Flow

1. Events are ingested via **Amazon Kinesis**
2. **Apache Flink** performs real-time transformations and stateful processing
3. Security rules detect abnormal behavior (bots, spikes, DDoS patterns)
4. Alerts are triggered and state is stored in **DynamoDB**
5. Events are written to **Apache Hudi tables on S3**
6. Batch analytics queries provide business insights

---

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

* **~50% faster query performance** using Apache Hudi
* **~40% storage reduction** through optimized file layouts
* Low-latency streaming analytics with stateful processing

---

## 🔐 Security Detection Logic

* Rate-based anomaly detection
* Behavioral pattern analysis
* Stateful IP/session tracking
